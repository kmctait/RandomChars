# RandomChars
A simple application to produce random weird characters of random length with a random delay to look like Matrix-style data crunching.

## Introduction

At the moment, the character set is hardcoded to the Unicode character range for Ethiopic characters, to look 'other worldly'

For a quick guide on character sets, see click [here](http://jrgraphix.net/research/unicode_blocks.php)

The length, delay and character set are hardcoded at the moment for ease of execution.

## Running the package

The packaged Jar file is run without arguments:

```bash
java -jar RandomChars.jar
```

### TO DO

- Character set, delay and string length should be arguments, rather than hardcoded
- Change background colour and text colour to something more artistically digital
